                <p>What "Unlimited" DOES NOT mean: The accounts are not intended to support the greater web hosting
                  needs of large enterprises, to be used as an online storage warehouse to store backups, archiving of
                  electronic files or emails,
                  documents, log files, etc., to be used as a media file streaming/sharing hub, or used for any

                <p>Lean & Strong's "Unlimited" services are provisioned in a shared hosting environment. Any account
                  found to

                  Serious offenses will

                  Dispute resolution
                </h6>
                <p><strong>INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS.</strong> To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute,
                  controversy or claim related to this Agreement ("Dispute"), you agree to first attempt to negotiate
                  any Dispute (except those
                  Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any
                  arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon your written notice to
                  Lean & Strong. Your address
                  for any notices under the Agreement is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address
                  you have provided to Lean & Strong.
                </p>
                <p><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong> If you and Lean & Strong are unable to resolve a Dispute
                  through
                  informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly
                  excluded below) will be finally
                  and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final
                  and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL
                  HAVE THE RIGHT
                  TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the
                  Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "ICA Rules") of the Indian Council of Arbitration ("ICA") and, where
                  appropriate, the ICA's
                  Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("ICA Consumer Rules"), both of which are
                  available at the ICA website<a>https://www.icaindia.co.in/</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share
                  of arbitrator compensation
                  will be governed by the ICA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the ICA Consumer Rules). If your
                  claim for damages does not exceed Rs. 2,000/-, Lean & Strong will pay all such fees unless the
                  arbitrator
                  finds that either
                  the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was
                  brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in The Code Rule of Civil
                  Procedure 11(b)). The
                  arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The
                  arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
                  requested by a party. The
                  arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do
                  so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Lean & Strong may litigate in court to
                  compel
                  arbitration, stay
                  proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered
                  by the arbitrator.</p>

                <p><strong>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</strong> Each party retains the right to bring
                  an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an
                  individual basis in Pune
                  court located in Maharashtra state of the India with respect to any dispute related to the actual or
                  threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's intellectual property or
                  proprietary rights.
                </p>
                <p><strong>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED
                    CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. </strong>You and Lean & Strong agree that any arbitration
                  will
                  be limited to the Dispute between Lean & Strong and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
                  YOU
                  AND Lean & Strong ARE EACH
                  WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR
                  REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Lean & Strong otherwise agree, the arbitrator
                  may
                  not consolidate more
                  than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
                  proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute
                  Resolution" Section will
                  be deemed null and void.
                </p>
                <p><strong>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.</strong> Arbitration will take place in Pune, Maharashtra. You and
                  Lean & Strong agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in
                  any
                  small claims court), or
                  where no election to arbitrate has been made, the Pune court located in Maharashtra have exclusive
                  jurisdiction and you and Lean & Strong agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
